# ALX printf Project

This project is part of the ALX software engineering program. The goal of this project is to implement a simplified version of the standard C library printf function, which allows formatted printing of text to the standard output.

# Project Overview

The printf function takes a format string and a variable number of arguments, and prints the formatted text to the standard output. The format string can contain format specifiers, which start with the % character, and specify how each argument should be formatted and printed.

In this project, we will be implementing a simplified version of printf, which supports the following format specifiers:

+ %c - print a single character
+ %s - print a null-terminated string
+ %d -print a signed decimal integer
+ %i - print a signed decimal integer (same as %d)
